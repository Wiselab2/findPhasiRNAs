# findPhasiRNAs

## Introduction

lant genomes encode abundant but diverse populations of small non-coding RNAs, which can be broadly divided into microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Endogenous siRNAs can be further grouped into several sub-classes such as heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), natural antisense siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs). The role of miRNAs as post-transcriptional regulators is well known. Among siRNAs, tasiRNAs and natsiRNAs are known to act as guide molecules for post-transcriptional gene regulation, and heterochromatic siRNAs in transcriptional gene silencing, but the role of phasiRNAs in gene regulation is still unclear. PhasiRNAs are produced from both protein-coding and noncoding genes. In many eudicots, three large gene families generate the majority of phasiRNAs, including those encoding nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NB-LRR genes), pentatricopeptide repeat proteins (PPR genes), and MYB transcription factors (MYB genes). 

This pipeline takes a statistical approach to obtain genomic loci where there is a strong signal of phasing. It computes p-values and also phasing scores.
